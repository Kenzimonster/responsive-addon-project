                  <h4>BOYSHIT</h4>
                  <p>
                    Madison is expressing the idea that she is dealing with a boy assuming he is a man but is not showing it through his childish ways. 
                    Her not speaking “boyshit” implies she speaks “manshit” which would require a boy complementary to her level of mental maturity. 
                    This would have in itself remedied this state of her frustration and confusion stemming from his indecision and lack of personal accountability.
